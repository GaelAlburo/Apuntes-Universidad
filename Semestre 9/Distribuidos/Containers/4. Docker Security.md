We want to reduce the possibilities of attack
A container can be dangerous because it has access to the kernel
One way to protect is to limit the amount of HW the container has access to
	through limits or flags(memory, CPU)


- create docker-composer.yml
	deploy: 
		resources:
			limits: (in here we can define the ammount of memory and cpu)
	
- socket: physical processor
- cpu: what the socket emulates inside (i7 - 9)
- nucelo: virtual (i7-11)
- microprocessor: new measure for containers. 0-1000 (1000 - 1 cpu)


## docker-compose.yml
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:1.27.0-alpine3.19
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 8080:80
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 256M
          cpus: 0.5     

start the container: docker compose up -d
with: docker stats to view all the resources the container uses
	here we can confirm our limits were set correctly


# DOCKERIGNORE
we can use .dockerignore file to tell what files or directories not to upload to the container
we create a mkdir app with app.py inside it
now we create the Dockerfile
	FROM python:3.9-slim
	WORKDIR /usr/src/app
	COPY . .
	CMD ["python", "app.py"]
	
we create .dockerignore
	in this file we put every file we dont want in the container
we create .env file

we create the docker-compose.yml:
	services:
	  app:
	    build: ./app
	    container_name: app
	    deploy:
	      resources:
		limits:
		  memory: 256M
		  cpus: '0.5'

now we execute the docker compose: docker compose up -d (it has to be at same level as the docker-compose.yml)
we get inside the container: docker exec -ti app bash
	in here we do: ls -la
	we wont see all the files that were specified inside the .dockerignore

	(vault: place to store credentials and access them safely. Example: HCP Vault, AWS KMS, AZURE KEYVAULT)

# VULNERABILITY SCAN
nmap, nc (give this commands an URL of IP, and it tells us what ports are open)

trivy - vulnerabilities at container level
dockle - vulnerabilities at image level

create mkdir sec_scan
inside it create an index.html
create a Dockerfile
	FROM nginx:1.27.0
	WORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html
	COPY . .
	EXPOSE 80
	CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
	
we build the image created: docker build -t web-app:latest .
we can see web-app inside docker images

### TRIVY
we're gonna verify the vulnearibilites of the image: trivy image web-app:latest
	we can view the local images or an image of docker hub
	
	it will download the db vulnerabilities known, from the aqua company.
	I get an error because host doesnt have enough space 
	at the end we'll see the vulnerabilty report
	
	to fix the vulnerabilities we use another base image:
	nginx:1.27.0-alpine3.19-slim
	
the images based on alpine are much safer, this version doesnt show as many vulnerabilities when executing trivy

### DOCKLE
dockle web-app:latest
this one goes to the configuration of Dockerfile
we can put the vulnerabilities in a .dockerignore so when we execute dockle it doesnt show

- we fix the user vulnerability by adding a user in Dockerfile
- we fix the latest tag by building with a v1.0.0 tag
- we fix the docker trus by executing the command b4 the build
- we fix HEALTHCHECK by installing curl and adding HEALTHCHECK instruction
- we fix the last error by adding it to the .dockerignore because its a false positive

	FROM nginx:1.27.0-alpine3.19-slim
	WORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html
	RUN addgroup -S appuser && adduser -S appuser -G appuser
	RUN apk add --no-cache curl
	COPY . .
	USER appuser
	EXPOSE 80
	HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
		CMD curl -f http://localhost:80/ || exit 1
	CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

after fixing all vulneabilities we can actually run the container:
